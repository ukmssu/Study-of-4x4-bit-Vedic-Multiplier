# Study-of-4x4-bit-Vedic-Multiplier

Multipliers are essential in modern digital signal processing (DSP) and many other applications such as high-speed arithmetic logic units (ALUs), microcomputers, and image processing. However, the Multiplication demands more computing power and time-consuming hardware resources compared to addition and subtraction. With the recent rise of portable electronics, designers are looking for ways to enhancing the efficiency of current designs for improved performance. Vedic mathematics, which includes 16 sutras, provides efficient techniques for multiplication, particularly the "Urdhva Tiryagbhyam" and "Nikhilam Navatashcaramam Dashatah" sutras. This paper focuses on the implementation of these sutras for multiplying two 4x4 binary numbers using a Vedic multiplier designed using Verilog HDL in Xilinx Vivado 2020.2.
