# Study-of-4x4-bit-Vedic-Multiplier

## Abstract
Multipliers are essential in modern digital signal processing (DSP) and many other applications such as high-speed arithmetic logic units (ALUs), microcomputers, and image processing. However, the Multiplication demands more computing power and time-consuming hardware resources compared to addition and subtraction. With the recent rise of portable electronics, designers are looking for ways to enhancing the efficiency of current designs for improved performance. Vedic mathematics, which includes 16 sutras, provides efficient techniques for multiplication, particularly the "Ur- dhva Tiryagbhyam" and "Nikhilam Navatashcaramam Dashatah" sutras. This paper focuses on the implementation of these sutras for multiplying two 4x4 binary numbers using a Vedic multiplier designed using Verilog HDL in Xilinx Vivado 2020.2.


KEYWORDS: Vedic sutras; Urdhva Tiryagbhyam; Nikhilam Navatashcaramam Dashatah; Verilog HDL.

## Objective of the work
The primary objective of this project is to :-

• Understanding logic behind each one Vedic Sutras.

– Urdhva Tiryagbhyam.

– Nikhilam Navatascaramam Dasatah.

• Understanding different techniques to reduce the latency of vedic multiplier using these Sutras.

• Implementing 4x4 vedic multipliers for binary number system in xilinx Vivado using verilog HDL.

• Performing the delay and area analysis of these multipliers.

## Conclusion
In this paper we studied vedic multipliers using two of the sixteen sutra from ancient Indian vedic literature. Namely Nikhilam Navatascaramam Dasatah Sutra and Urdhva Tiryagbhyam Sutra In this report I went through and studied the logic behind both the algorithm Nikhilam Navatascaraman Sasatah Sutra and Urdhva Tiryagbyam Sutra. This report also contains the Implementing of 4x4 vedic multipliers using Urdhva Tiryagbyam Sutra for binary number system in xilinx Vivado using verilog HDL and performed delay and area analysis of the multiplier (Using Urdhva Tiryagbyam Sutra).
